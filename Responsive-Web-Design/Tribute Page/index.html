    <div id="one">
      <li>Srinivasa Ramanujan (22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India.</li>
      <li>
        When Ramanujan was thirteen, he could work out S.L. Loney’s Trigonometry exercises without any help!
      </li>
      <li>
        This self-taught mathematician received degree from Trinity College,Cambridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        22nd December is called National Mathematics Day in India because of Ramanujan's birth-anniversary!
      </li>
      <li>
        After a funny incident, 1729 is called Hardy-Ramanujam number in his honor, and such numbers are called Taxicab numbers.
      </li>
      <li>He became one of the youngest Fellow of Royal Society and the first Indian to be elected as Fellow of Trinity College,Cambridge.</li>
        <li>
          During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations.
      </li>
        <li>
          Of his original letters, G.H. Hardy stated that a single look was enough to show they could only have been written by a mathematician of the highest calibre, comparing Ramanujan to mathematical geniuses such as Euler and Jacobi.
      </li>
      <li>In 1910, after a meeting between the 23-year-old Ramanujan and the founder of the Indian Mathematical Society, V. Ramaswamy Aiyer, Ramanujan began to get recognition in Madras's mathematical circles, leading to his inclusion as a researcher at the University </li>
      <li>Hardy came up with a scale of mathematical ability that went from 0 to 100. He put himself at 25. David Hilbert, the great German mathematician, was at 80. Ramanujan was 100.</li>
      <li>When he died in 1920 at the age of 32, Ramanujan left behind three notebooks and a sheaf of papers (the “lost notebook”). These notebooks contained thousands of results that are still inspiring mathematical work decades later.</li>
